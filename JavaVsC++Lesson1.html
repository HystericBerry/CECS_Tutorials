</a>Lesson 1: Differences in Philosophies and Compilation Processes</h2>
<p>It is very easy for beginners to assume that programming languages like Java and C++ are the same simply because the syntaxes are 
similar. As a matter of fact, one reason as to why Java and C++ seem the same is because Java is written in C++; however, both languages 
were developed with different goals in mind. Although the languages appear to be similar on the surface, they differ greatly when they 
are observed at a deeper and internal level. To truly understand Java, we must first understand its origin, C++. In a series of lectures, 
we will cover the philosophical and practical differences between Java and C++.</p>


<h3>History of the Programming Languages</h3>
<p>In the early 1970s, a researcher scientist by the name Dennis Ritchie developed a language in Bell Labs called C. Originally, the C 
language was meant to help Dennis and his partners develop an operating system for a computer in Bell Labs. The operating system they 
developed is commonly known as UNIX. The birth of UNIX sparked other researchers' and developers' curiosities and the popularity of C and 
UNIX grew in tandem.</p>

<p>Due to C's emphasis on control flow and data structures, it became the default language among system programmers. As C grew more 
popular, a computer scientist by the name of Bjarne Stroustrup recognized the need for a language that provided tools for large software 
development while performing fast, low-level calculations. Stroustrup created a set of standardized libraries and macros called "C with 
Classes" which later became the programming language C++. The development of this extension was an attempt to introduce Object-Oriented 
Programming (OOP) to C programmers while "guaranteeing" a comfortable transition from C to C++, hence the title "C <strong>with Classes.
</strong>" Unfortunately, many C programmers struggled to comprehend the new OOP craze that C++ brought. The sheer difference in solving 
a problem with sequential logic (C programming) and OOP logic (C++ programming) led to the decision of making C++ its own language.</p>

<p>In 1991, James Gosling and Patrick Naughton of Sun Microsystems designed a programming language by the name "Green." It was developed 
for consumer, embedded systems - such as VCRs - with the idea of creating software that was simple, secure and compatible for many 
different computer architectures. The Green development team adopted the "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) slogan to entice customers; 
unfortunately, customers were not interested and many software did not run on different architectures as promised. In 1994, the Green 
development team realized the language could instead be used to develop browsers and applets. By 1995, the language was revamped and 
reintroduced at SunWorld exhibition as the new and improved Java. Since then, Java has grown astronomically. The Java development team 
has included an abundance of libraries, GUI frameworks, compiler and language fixes. It properly supports different computer architectures 
and is arguably one of the easier and safer programming languages.</p>

<p>Currently, Java and C++ are among the top OOP programming languages. Java and C++ have many fans and this often leads to disputes about 
which language is better; however, it is important to know that there is no better language. Instead, it is proper to say that one language 
is the better choice in a particular programming environment or project. Programming languages are tools meant to decrease effort and errors. 
When a programmer develops software, the goal must harmonize with the language of choice. Whether the language and software syncs often 
depends on the language's philosophy and resources.</p>


<h3>Difference in Philosophies</h3>
<p>*Notes will be updated*</p>

<h3>Misconceptions</h3>
<p>*Notes will be updated*</p>

<h3>Difference in Compilation Processes</h3>
<p>Java's key Philosophy is "Write once, Run Anywhere." C++'s key Philosophy is "If you don't want it, you don't pay for it." In programming, 
"paying for something" often refers to performance (space and time complexity)</p>

<h3>Homework and Quizzes</h3>
<p>Homework will be posted at a later time.</p>
<p>Before we move on to more advanced topics, take the time to refresh your understanding in Java: 
<a href="JavaVsC++Quiz0.html">Quiz 0: Java Assessment</a>. It will make the future concepts easier to understand. Each solution will 
list the topics you need to cover if you answer incorrectly.</p>
