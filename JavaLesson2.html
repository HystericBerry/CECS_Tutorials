<p>In this section, we will explore a simple and iconic Java program that prints a string "Hello World!" to the console. 
I will explain the purpose and general structure to the each line of code.
</p>

<h3>Hello World!</h3>

<p>Source Code:
<img src="images/JavaLesson2.png" height="600" alt="Hello World Program">

<pre><code> /**
   * Code encased by asterisks and forward slashes are ignored by the compiler.
   * These lines of codes are known as "comments" and are purely meant for users.
   */
</code></pre>

Lines 1-4 are known as documentation comments. These comments are typically multi-lined and describe the nature and 
functionality of an algorithm or code. Java programmers also refer to them as Java Docs. Documentation is important 
because it teaches users how to properly use code (ex: return type, parameters, runtime, etc). Later, we will learn 
how to properly Java Doc your won classes and objects.

<pre><code> import java.util.Scanner;
</code></pre>

Line 5 imports a standard package that Java provides. We are including, from the util package, a class Scanner and 
all classes that are linked with it. The package you choose to import depends on the functionality and memory 
intensity of your program. To determine which packages you may need to include, <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/">Oracle</a> provides *Java Docs*. This 
lets you, the user, easily implement their code while ensuring compatability with other software developers. Rather 
than having multiple versions of a particular data structure, you can simply use a universally accepted code.
