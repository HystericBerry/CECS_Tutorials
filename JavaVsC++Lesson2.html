</a>Lesson 2: Fundamental Data Types in Java and C++</h2>
<p>In this lecture, we will learn how Java and C++ handles Fundamental Data Types. It is important to understand how this works for the 
the following reasons:</p>

<p><pre><code><li>Optimize your program</li>
<li>Debug your program</li>
<li>Maintain Data Integrity</li>
</code></pre></p>

<p>In programming, choosing which data type you use is important to optimizing your code because it is less cpu and memory intensive. If all 
shopping carts were 10 feet x 10 feet x 10 feet large, everyone would have a difficult time shopping. Similarly, choosing a data type of size 8 
Bytes while only using 1 bit would be unnecessary. This tends to matter especially with mission critical software - software that has a limited 
amount of hard drive and cpu strength (ex: airplanes). Conversely, choosing a data type that is too small is just as harmful. Imagine shopping 
for mattresses with a shopping cart a big as a cellphone. By attempting to "shove" large information into a tiny space, we are losing information, 
this is called truncating.</p>

<p>Knowing how data types work also helps when debugging (fixing) errors. As stated above, attempting to shove large data into a smaller/ confined 
space results in a loss of data. When you lose data, you are not performing calculations on all the data that was intended. This can result in 
improper indexing (searching) and inaccurate answers. The idea of maintaining and assuring accuracy of data over time is called <strong>Data 
Integrity</strong>.</p>

<h3>Argument Promotion and Implicit Conversions</h3>
<p>Order of Precedence</p>
<p>Order of Precedence is equivalent to the Order of Operations in Mathematics, but with additional operators. By following the "Please Excuse 
My Dear Aunt Sally" rule, it is important to note that exponential notation does not inheritly exist in Java and C++. Hence, users must either 
import libraries with an exponent function or multiply the number (N) x number of times (N*N*N*...*N). Otherwise, statements in both <a href=
"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/operators.html">Java</a> and <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/
operator_precedence">C++</a> are executed from left to right. Click on the links to view order of precedence before moving on.</p>

<p>Let's take a look at some examples:</p>
<pre><code>int a = 4, b = 13;
System.out.println(a + b);
<div><a href="#" class="show_hide">Hint</a>
    <div class="slidingDiv">There is only one operator and no left hand expression.</div></div>
</code></pre>
<div><a href="#" class="show_hide">Solution</a>
    <div class="slidingDiv">17</div></div>

<pre><code>int a = 4, b = 13, c;
System.out.println(a + b * b);
<div><a href="#" class="show_hide">Hint</a>
    <div class="slidingDiv">There are now two operators: + and *. We know from basic mathematics that the * operator takes 
precedence over the + operator.</div></div>
</code></pre>
<div><a href="#" class="show_hide">Solution</a>
    <div class="slidingDiv">173</div></div>

<p>Strings tend to make operations more confusing:</p>
<pre><code>int a = 4, b = 13;
System.out.println("a + b = " + a + b);
<div><a href="#" class="show_hide">Hint</a>
    <div class="slidingDiv">There are now two operators of <strong>equivalent</strong> precedence.</div></div>
</code></pre>
<div><a href="#" class="show_hide">Solution</a>
    <div class="slidingDiv">Because there are only two operators with equal precedence, the statement is executed from left to right. 
This means that "a + b = " + a will be evaluated first, resulting in the String concatenation: "a + b = 4". Then, the resulting String 
will be concatenated again in the statement "a + b = 4" + b. Answer:
<br>a + b =413</div></div>

<p>Important concepts when writing mathematical statements in programming are the <strong>Mixed-Type Expression</strong> and <strong>
implicit conversion rule</strong>. Mixed-Type Expression describes the mixing of different data types in one mathematical statement. 
If we attempt to add an integer to a double, will the result be an integer or a double? Questions like these are answered by the concept 
of implicit conversion. As programmers, one of the important rules we try to uphold is the Data Integrity rule. If an integer and double 
resulted in an integer, this would imply we <i>lost</i> data. In order prevent inaccurate data, programming languages should and will always 
<strong>promote</strong> the resulting expression to the data type of highest precision that was used. Let's take the following generic 
equation: integer * character + float + double. By Order of Precedence, we have a * that is prioritized over two + operators. An integer * 
character will result in an integer because an integer is more precise and holds more data than a character data type (remember: all data types 
are technically stored/ represented as a number in Hexadecimal/binary; therefore, doing math with integers and characters is completely viable). 
Now, the expression has transformed from integer * character + float + double to integer + float + double. Because a float holds more data and 
is more precise than an integer, an integer + float results in a float data type. Finally, a double is more precise than a float. The final 
solution to the generic equation results in a double data type. The general result for any Argument Promotion will always be: </p>
<pre><code>Promotion Rules:
Low Precision -> High Precision = data remains intact
High Precision -> Low Precision = truncate/ lost data</code></pre>

<p>We'll take a look at some examples to clear any confusion:</p>
<pre><code>int a = 4, b = 13;
double c = 3.1;
System.out.println(a + b + c);
<div><a href="#" class="show_hide">Hint</a>
    <div class="slidingDiv">Equal operators = Equal Precedence. int + int + double</div></div>
</code></pre>
<div><a href="#" class="show_hide">Solution</a>
    <div class="slidingDiv">Because all operators are of equal precedence, we read the statement from left to right. int + int results in an int 
and the resulting int + double results in a double. 4 + 13 + 3.1 -> 17 + 3.1 -> 20.1 Answer:
<br>20.1</div></div>
