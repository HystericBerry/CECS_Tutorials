</a>Lesson 2: Fundamental Data Types in Java and C++</h2>
<p>In this lecture, we will learn how Java and C++ handles Fundamental Data Types. It is important to understand how this works for the 
the following reasons:</p>

<p><pre><code><li>Optimize your program</li>
<li>Debug your program</li>
<li>Maintain Data Integrity</li>
</code></pre></p>

<p>In programming, choosing which data type you use is important to optimizing your code - less cpu and memory intensive. If all shopping 
carts were 10 feet x 10 feet x 10 feet large, everyone would have a difficult time shopping. Similarly, choosing a data type of size 8 Bytes 
while only using 1 bit would be unnecessary. This tends to matter especially with mission critical software - software that has a limited 
amount of hard drive and cpu strength (ex: airplanes). Conversely, choosing a data type that is too small is just as harmful. Imagine shopping 
for mattresses with a shopping cart a big as a cellphone. By attempting to "shove" large information into a tiny space, we are losing information, 
this is called truncating.</p>

<p>Knowing how data types work also helps when debugging (fixing) errors. As stated above, attempting to shove large data into a smaller/ confined 
space results in a loss of data. When you lose data, you are not performing calculations on all the data that was intended. This can result in 
improper indexing (searching) and inaccurate answers. The idea of maintaining and assuring accuracy of data over time is called <strong>Data 
Integrity</strong>.</p>

<h3>Comparison of Fundamental Data Types</h3>

<h3>Argument Promotion and Implicit Conversions</h3>
<p>Order of Precedence</p>
<p>Order of Precedence is equivalent to the Order of Operations in Mathematics, but with additional operators. By following the "Please Excuse 
My Dear Aunt Sally" rule, it is important to note that exponential notation does not inheritly exist in Java and C++. Hence, users must either 
import libraries with an exponent function or multiply the number (N) x number of times (N*N*N*...*N). Otherwise, statements in both <a href=
"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/operators.html">Java</a> and <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/
operator_precedence">C++</a> are executed from left to right. </p>

<p>Let's take a look at some examples:</p>
<p>*Notes will be updated later*</p>

<p>Concept: Mixed-Type Expression (Promotion Rule)</p>
<p>Low -> High Precision = data remains intact</p>
<p>High -> Low Precision = truncate/ lost data</p>
