<p> In this section, we will take quick look at programming history, basic computer architecture, and the Life Cycle 
of Java code.</p>

<h3>Life Cycle of a Java Program</h3>

<p> Understanding the life cycle (flow) of a Java program is essential to understanding the philosophy of Java and 
its unique attributes that distinguish it from other programming languages.

<br> It is important to note that the source code you produce is often converted into different formats. This is 
done to ensure portability from one platform to another. In Java, this is accomplished by the following process:

<ul>
	<li>Integrated Development Environment (IDE)</li>
	<li>.java file</li>
	<li>Java Compiler</li>
	<li>.class file</li>
	<li>Java Virtual Machine</li>
	<li>Machine Language</li>
</ul>

<br><strong>Integrated Development Environment: </strong>
<br> Source code is a list of commands you want to compile. In this tutorial, you can develop source code through 
an editor such as Eclipse or Netbeans. This is simply an <i>environment</i> that assists you in writing your code 
with tools such as Data Structures, consoles, and debugging features. As a matter of fact, you can directly write 
your source code in an empty text file and change the extension from .txt to .java.

<br><br><strong>.java Files: </strong>
<br> As mentioned above, .java files contain code that has a purpose and task. This code is represented by Java, a 
programming language designed to convey english and mathematical statements to computers.
<br> Here is a theoretical example as to why Java is preferred to machine language: 

<pre><code> public FirstAssignment {
<br><span style="padding-left:20px">public static void main(String args[]) {</span>
<br><span style="padding-left:40px">int x = 5, y = 5;</span>
<br><span style="padding-left:40px">System.out.println(x + y);</span>
<br><span style="padding-left:20px">}</span>
<br>}
</code></pre>

<br> In the example above, the FirstAssignment.java (written through a text file or IDE such as Eclipse) contains 
<i>source code</i>. The source code does not necessarily contain syntactically correct English or mathematical 
statements; however, humans can understand the purpose of the code. As mentioned above, computers only understand 
high voltage and low voltage signals (1's and 0's). Clearly, communicating with computers through programming 
languages such as Java reduce errors and increase efficiency as opposed to communicating with numbers:

<pre><code> #0x92
<br> #0x23
<br> #0x66
<br> #0x87
<br> #0xF5
</code></pre>
