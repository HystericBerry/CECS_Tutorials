{"name":"Paul Kim","tagline":"pkim7662@gmail.com","body":"### About Me:\r\nMy name is Paul Kim. I am a Computer Science student enrolled in California State University of Long Beach. I changed my major twice from Mechanical Engineering and Electrical Engineering before becoming a Computer Science major.\r\n\r\n### Skills\r\n\r\n```\r\nJava\r\nC++\r\nXilinx\r\nAssembly Language\r\nJavascript\r\nHTML\r\nMicrosoft Office\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Accomplishments\r\n\r\nACM ICPC Southern California Regional\r\n\r\nFall 2014: \r\n```\r\nPlacement: 49\r\nTeam: You Got Hacked!\r\nhttp://icpc.baylor.edu/regionals/finder/southern-california-2014/standings\r\n```\r\nAlthough 49 may not be considered impressive, I still believe I can improve. After some reflection, I realized one of the greatest weaknesses of CSULB is the lack of programming exercises that properly integrate advanced algorithms and/ or data structures (AVL, Greedy Algorithm, etc). There is only one absolute solution to this problem: practice. During Summer break of 2015, I will practice past ICPC programming problems from the acm-icpc archive.\r\n\r\nMy goal for the next ICPC Regional contest in Fall 2015 is to place in the top 35.\r\n\r\n### Projects\r\nI developed a stage-clearing Zelda game for my Software Engineering course Fall 2014. This game was developed by two people (myself and Dean Garcia). Unfortunately, our group was the only group that consisted of two students.
